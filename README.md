ESP32-CAM Presence Detection with Audio Recording and Remote Control
This project leverages the ESP32-CAM module's capabilities to create a real-time presence detection system with audio recording and remote control features. It continuously monitors ambient noise through the integrated microphone, triggering audio capture to a microSD card when human presence is likely detected. Additionally, the project offers optional remote arming/disarming functionality for enhanced user control.

Features
Continuous Presence Detection: Utilizes real-time audio analysis to identify human presence based on sound characteristics.
Audio Recording to MicroSD: Captures audio upon presence detection, storing it securely on the microSD card for later review.
Remote Control (Optional): Allows remote enabling/disabling of presence detection via a user-defined method (e.g., web interface, mobile app).
Hardware Requirements

ESP32-CAM module
MicroSD card (capacity based on recording needs)
(Optional) Additional components for chosen remote control method (e.g., web server components, smartphone app development kit)
Software Requirements

ESP-IDF development framework (https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/)
Libraries for audio processing and microSD card access (specific libraries to be determined during development)
(Optional) Libraries and frameworks for chosen remote control method
Installation

Set up ESP-IDF development environment: Follow the official guide to install the ESP-IDF framework and configure your development environment for ESP32 programming. Refer to the ESP-IDF documentation for detailed instructions: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/
Clone the project repository: (Replace <URL> with the actual URL of your project repository on GitHub)
Bash
git clone <URL>
Use code with caution.
Install project dependencies: (Specific instructions will depend on the chosen audio processing and remote control libraries. Consult their documentation for installation steps)
Usage

Compile and flash the code to your ESP32-CAM module using ESP-IDF tools.
Insert a microSD card into the ESP32-CAM module.
(Optional) Configure the chosen remote control method according to its specific instructions.

Additional Notes

Consider power consumption strategies, especially if continuous operation is desired. Explore low-power modes when feasible.
Adhere to responsible use and privacy considerations when capturing audio recordings.
Security measures might be necessary if implementing remote control features over a network.
